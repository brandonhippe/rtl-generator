# RTL-Generator

This repository contains an RTL-Generator and flexible parameterizer written in Python. Documentation is ongoing, so check back here later to learn how to use this program.

For now, this program can be tested by running `pip install -e .` from a clone of this directory, and running any of `gen-rtl setup`, `gen-rtl update`, or `gen-rtl generate`.
